### GNU Radio OOT module for NRSC-5

Connects [nrsc5](https://github.com/theori-io/nrsc5) to [gnuradio](https://www.gnuradio.org/)

Audio output and switching programs while running work. There's an included example grc. I don't need anything more at the moment.

Requires [my branch of nrsc5](https://github.com/Albert-S-Briscoe/nrsc5)
